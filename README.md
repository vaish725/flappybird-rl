## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project implements and compares two reinforcement learning algorithmsâ€”**Deep Q-Networks (DQN)** and **Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C)**â€”to solve the game of *Flappy Bird*. The agent learns an optimal policy to survive as long as possible, with observations restricted to simulate partial observability.

The project is designed to meet the course requirement of solving a **stochastic sequential decision problem** using a feasible and scalable RL-based approach.

## ðŸ§  Algorithms Used

- **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**
- **Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C)**

Implemented using **PyTorch**, with training metrics such as average survival time per episode, convergence rate and total reward over time.

## ðŸŽ® Environment

The environment is adapted from [sourabhv/FlapPyBird](https://github.com/sourabhv/FlapPyBird).
